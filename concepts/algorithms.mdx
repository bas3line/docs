## Overview

UltraBalancer supports 7 algorithms. Choose based on your needs.

## Algorithms

### round-robin (default)
Even distribution across all backends.
```bash
ultrabalancer -a round-robin -b s1:8080 -b s2:8080
```
**Best for:** Similar backends, stateless apps

### least-connections
Routes to backend with fewest active connections.
```bash
ultrabalancer -a least-connections -b s1:8080 -b s2:8080
```
**Best for:** Variable response times, long connections

### ip-hash
Same client IP always goes to same backend.
```bash
ultrabalancer -a ip-hash -b s1:8080 -b s2:8080
```
**Best for:** Session affinity needed

### random
Random backend selection.
```bash
ultrabalancer -a random -b s1:8080 -b s2:8080
```
**Best for:** Simple distribution, development

### weighted
Higher weight = more requests.
```bash
ultrabalancer -a weighted -b s1:8080:200 -b s2:8080:100
```
**Best for:** Backends with different capacities

### power-of-two
Picks 2 random backends, uses the one with fewer connections.
```bash
ultrabalancer -a power-of-two -b s1:8080 -b s2:8080 -b s3:8080
```
**Best for:** High performance, distributed choice

### fastest-response
Routes to backend with fastest recent response.
```bash
ultrabalancer -a fastest-response -b s1:8080 -b s2:8080
```
**Best for:** Latency-sensitive applications
